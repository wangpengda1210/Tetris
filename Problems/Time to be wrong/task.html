<h2>Time to be wrong</h2>

  <p>The most effective way to learn to read traceback is to be wrong. Therefore, there are errors in the <code class="java">print_list()</code> function below that you need to fix. After each fix, you can run the code and read the traceback to find a new error.</p> 
  <p>If the function is called in the following way: <code class="java">print_list([1, '2', 3, '4'])</code>, then the output should be like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2
0
4</code></pre> 
  <p>You do NOT need to call a function in the code section. Just bring it to working condition.</p>

<b>Caution</b><br><br>
You may see errors in your code or execution results due to missing context. Donâ€™t worry about it, just write the solution and press Check.
