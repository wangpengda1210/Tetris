  <p>The Kitten and his best Puppy are learning NumPy. They have learned a lot about boolean operations and decided to solve this task in Hyperskill. Unfortunately, they have only read the input. Help them and finish the program!</p> 
  <p>You have three lines in the input. The first one contains integers separated by spaces, the second line and the third one contain some words. Your task is to create 3 arrays, they are guaranteed to be of the same length. Then, for each number in the first array, check if it is negative or not. If it is <em>non-negative</em> (equal to 0 or more than 0), print the corresponding element from the <em>second</em> array. If it <em>is</em> negative, print the corresponding element from the <em>third</em> array.</p>

   You can use 
   <code class="java">np.where()</code> for checking![/TITLE]
